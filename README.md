# CarcassonneGame
A web implementation of the classic board game Carcassonne. 

## Developing

* `npm install` to resolve dependencies
* `npm run watch` to start transpile watch. This command will read files under `client/src` and generate a single file under `client/dist/bundle.js` which should be included by index.html
